# Agentic Workflow

**Agentic Workflow** is an example implementation of AI agents into an existing project. It demonstrates how to
integrate OpenAI-powered agents using **SmolAgents, LiteLLM, FastAPI, and MongoDB**, enabling intelligent automation and
decision-making within applications.

# AI Agents and SmolAgents

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are **autonomous systems** that can **perceive**, **reason**, and **act** based on their environment. They use
machine learning models, APIs, and logic to complete tasks such as:

- Answering questions
- Automating workflows
- Making decisions
- Interacting with APIs and databases

AI agents can be:

- **Reactive Agents** â€“ Respond to inputs and take actions
- **Proactive Agents** â€“ Act independently to achieve goals

## What Is SmolAgents?

[SmolAgents](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer/) is a lightweight **agent framework** designed for simplicity and
efficiency. It provides a structure for building AI-powered agents that can:

- Use **LLMs (Large Language Models)** like OpenAI
- Call APIs and interact with external systems
- Manage tasks in an agentic workflow
- Maintain memory and context across interactions

SmolAgents is useful for embedding **AI-powered automation** into applications without the complexity of larger
frameworks.

## How Does It Fit Into `agentic-workflow`?

In `agentic-workflow`, **SmolAgents** acts as the backbone for AI-powered decision-making, handling:

- **LLM integration** (via LiteLLM)
- **API calls and external actions**
- **State management** for multi-step workflows

This allows for a modular and scalable approach to implementing AI-driven automation.

## Features

- âœ… AI agent integration using **SmolAgents**
- âœ… OpenAI-powered automation via **LiteLLM**
- âœ… Fast and scalable API with **FastAPI**
- âœ… Database storage and management with **MongoDB**
- âœ… Easily extensible architecture for custom AI-driven workflows

## Next Steps ðŸš€

Upcoming features planned for `agentic-workflow`:

- ðŸ”¹ **Migration from SmolAgents to LangChain & LangGraph** â€“ Enhanced agent management and workflow orchestration
- ðŸ”¹ **Human in the loop** â€“ Enable human intervention and feedback in agent workflows
- ðŸ”¹ **Memory and Long-Term Context** â€“ Improve decision-making with persistent memory
- ðŸ”¹ **Customizable Agent Roles** â€“ Define different agent personalities and expertise
- ðŸ”¹ **Integration with External APIs** â€“ Allow agents to interact with third-party services
- ðŸ”¹ **Dashboard for Monitoring Agents** â€“ Web UI to track agent activity and logs
- ðŸ”¹ **Docker Support** â€“ Containerized deployment for easier setup and scalability
